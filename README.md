## Real world issue:
How many times have you happened to reach a station to take a citybike and didn't find any of them available? <br/>
How much time did you loose to reaching a station and find a solution when you have realized that there are no citybikes available? <br/>
Besides, if the weather was not the best, probably it hasn't been a pleasant experience. <br/>
What would happened if you have a way to check the availability of the citybikes between the different stations based on some variables as instance the weather?

## Our solution:
Well, our final product is an application (or an add-on to a pre-existing HSL-application) that will give you the possibility to monitoring the availability of the citybikes in the different situations, by predicting for each hour the number of citybikes available in the closest stations and also based on other factors as weather, weekday and month.
